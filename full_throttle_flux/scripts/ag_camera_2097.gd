class_name AGCamera2097

## WipEout 2097 Style Chase Camera
## Follows the ship with speed-based zoom and smooth tracking
## Now with collision detection to prevent clipping through walls

## Reference to the ship being followed.
## Must be set for camera to function.
@export var ship: AGShip2097

@export_group("Position")

## Base offset from ship position (X = right, Y = up, Z = behind).
## Higher Y = camera sits higher above ship.
## Higher Z = camera sits further behind ship.
## Typical values: Y = 2.5-4.0, Z = 6.0-10.0
@export var base_offset := Vector3(0, 3.0, 8.0)

## Extra distance added at maximum speed.
## Camera pulls back as you go faster, enhancing sense of speed.
## 0 = no zoom effect, 2-4 = noticeable pullback at top speed.
@export var speed_zoom := 2.0

## How quickly camera moves to target position (units per second factor).
## Higher = snappier following, lower = more floaty/cinematic.
## Range: 4.0-12.0. Start with 8.0 for balanced feel.
@export var follow_speed := 8.0

@export_group("Look")

## How far ahead of the ship to look, based on velocity.
## Creates a sense of anticipation in the direction of travel.
## 0 = look directly at ship, 0.1-0.2 = slight prediction ahead.
@export var look_ahead := 0.1

## How quickly camera rotates to face target (factor per second).
## Higher = snappier rotation, lower = smoother panning.
## Range: 6.0-15.0. Start with 10.0.
@export var look_speed := 10.0

@export_group("Effects")

## Field of view at rest / low speed (degrees).
## Standard FOV, used when ship is slow or stationary.
## Typical range: 60-70.
@export var base_fov := 65.0

## Field of view at maximum speed (degrees).
## FOV increases with speed to enhance sense of velocity.
## Should be higher than base_fov. Typical range: 75-90.
@export var max_fov := 80.0

@export_group("Collision")

## Enable camera collision detection to prevent clipping through walls.
@export var collision_enabled := true

## How much to pull the camera back from collision point (safety margin).
## Prevents camera from touching the wall exactly. Range: 0.1-0.5
@export var collision_margin := 0.3

## How quickly camera returns to normal distance after collision (factor per second).
## Higher = snappier return, lower = smoother. Range: 3.0-10.0
@export var collision_recovery_speed := 5.0

## Collision mask - which layers the camera should collide with.
## Layer 1 = track geometry. Adjust if needed.
